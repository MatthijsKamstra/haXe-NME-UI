Skinnable UI Components for haXe NME

(more info later)

I use minimalcomps a lot in my AS3 prototyping, so I wanted to use it for haXe also.
Luckely someone did already the heavy lifting (Slaskis).
There are some changes made to the original haXe translation because it didn't work on Android.



Components
-------------------------
For my project I didn't need all components.
So I created a small (mobile) subset.

- CheckBox
- InputText
- Label
- PushButton
- RadioButton

and for easy positioning

- VBox
- HBox

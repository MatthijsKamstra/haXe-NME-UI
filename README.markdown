Skinnable UI Components for haXe NME

<img src="https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haXe-NME-UI/raw/master/Assets/screenshot.png" />

I use minimalcomps a lot in my AS3 prototyping, so I wanted to use it for haXe also.
Luckely someone did already the heavy lifting (Beeblerox).
There are some changes made to the original haXe translation because it didn't work on Android.


Todo
-------------------------
- CheckBox doesn't render correctly on Android
- RadioButton doesn't render correctly on Android


Components
-------------------------
For my project I didn't need all components.
So I created a small (mobile) subset.

- CheckBox
- InputText
- Label
- PushButton
- RadioButton

and for easy positioning

- VBox
- HBox


MinimalComps vs this
-------------------------
The original minimalcomps are still in working order, but the 
- dropshadows are gone (that doesn't work except in Flash)
- default font is "_sans"
